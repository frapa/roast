# Roast

Roast is a scientific computing library that features automatic differentiation.
You can think of it as a combination of the numpy and pytorch python libraries.

For now, GPU computing is not supported.

Roast will let you roast your computer.

**Important:** The library is, for now, highly experimental and thing will break,
until a proper stable state is reached.
